# Bevy experiments

Messing around with [bevy](https://bevyengine.org/).

Currently contains a simple 3D scene with a grid for a floor.

You can look around with the arrow keys and walk around with the keys `AWSD`.
The position and orientation of the camera are overlayed on the screen.

There is a blue rectangle in the middle of the scene. When you walk near it,
it turns red.
